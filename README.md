# 🗑️ WasteWise – Smart Waste Management App ♻️

WasteWise is a mobile app designed to empower users and communities to manage household waste responsibly. It allows users to categorize, track, and schedule waste pickups efficiently.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

In many regions, households lack structured waste disposal systems. Waste gets mixed, pickups are irregular, and communities have no data to act on. WasteWise addresses these gaps by providing a smart mobile-first solution for both users and municipal workers to streamline waste management, reduce landfill overflow, and encourage segregation.
